The String+Matching.py is the script to run the string matching and entity matching.

Simply open the script and run it, a file named "output.txt" will be created in the current folder.

Make sure the input files (fodors.csv and zagats.csv) are in the same directory as the script.

If you can open the "String Matching.ipynb" in Jupyter notebook, there will be a better view of the script processes.
